**Dataset**

The data set is attached in the folder (zoo.csv). It is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [Zoo Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Zoo). 

The data set zoo.data was read in processing and saved as csv format using a portion of the program written in lab#2. 

**Visualization Adaptation**

The visualization does not work if the categories for the animals (hair, airborne, etc.) is added, but does work for more animal entries if needed. 

**Beyond the Basic Requirements**

*Biological*

The users can mouseover the columns in the bar chart and a list of animal names that has this feature/is this type will appear in the console window. 

This feature gives the users separate lists of animals with different features and can be referenced with the types of animals. Evolutional connections between the types of animals through the features could possibly be summarized from the comparison. 

*Technical*

The features bar chart and the animal types bar chart are two different representations of the same dataset. 

The mouseover-print feature requires reading of the users mouse position and matching the reading with meaningful information output. 

**Instructions**

Download the "hw3.pde" and "zoo.csv" file into the same folder. 

Run "hw3.pde" in Processing.
